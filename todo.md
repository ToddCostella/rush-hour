- move should take a vehicle position as argument 

- validation should include car orientation into consideration. up/down on vertical, left/right on horizontal 

move direction determines head square. starting pos is min of coverage squares on up/left,max on down/right
- vehicle position should model list of squares covered instead of starting pos
- use head/tail of list to derive staring point of the move
